## Summary

Godon addresses the complex challenge of **continuous dinfrastructure
optimization** in dynamic environments through **multi-objective combinatorial
optimization** with an emphasis on meta-heuristic algorithms. It augments human
operators by mechanizing performance tuning, optimizing, rearranging,
calibrating of technology settings across stacks The overall focus is on open
technologies first.

## Conception

Modern infrastructure operations—whether **on-premise, cloud-native, or
hybrid**—face an inherently dynamic environment where traffic patterns change,
loads are volatile, and service interactions evolve rapidly.

This complexity often leads to **neglected performance tuning** due to:

- Intractable complexity as the main challenge
- Lacking resources in terms of engineering knowledge or capacity

This complexity is not less pronounced in **cloud environments** despite its
managed nature because there:

- **Elastic scaling** creates constantly changing optimization targets
- **Multi-cloud deployments** introduce heterogeneous infrastructure challenges
- **Managed services** limit configuration visibility while requiring optimization
- **Cost-performance tradeoffs** become more critical with pay-as-you-go models

Godon approaches this as a **continuous multi-objective combinatorial
optimization problem** that spans all infrastructure environments:

- **On-premise systems** requiring traditional performance tuning
- **Cloud deployments** with elastic, distributed architectures
- **Hybrid setups** bridging local and cloud resources

Further Godon makes stand out that:

- **Meta-heuristics** (e.g. Evolutionary Algorithms) excel in such complex optimization problem fields
- **Optimization** spans the entire **lifecycle** of technology instances

| **ML-Light Approach** | Not primarily a machine learning or data analysis oriented technology |
| **Minimal ML Usage** | Machine learning components kept to minimum |
| **Targeted ML Implementation** | ML ideally only used when needed in metaheuristic implementation details |
| **No Global Optimum Guarantee** | Does not guarantee finding global optimum in configuration search space |
| **Approximate Solutions** | Focuses on approximating better-than-untouched states rather than perfect optimization |
| **Application, Not Framework** | Functions as an application of metaheuristics rather than providing a metaheuristics framework |
