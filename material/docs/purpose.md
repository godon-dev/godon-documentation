## Summary

Godon addresses the complex challenge of **continuous dinfrastructure
optimization** in dynamic environments through **multi-objective combinatorial
optimization** with an emphasis on meta-heuristic algorithms. It augments human
operators by mechanizing performance tuning, optimizing, rearranging,
calibrating of technology settings across stacks The overall focus is on open
technologies first.

## Conception

Modern infrastructure operations—whether **on-premise, cloud-native, or
hybrid**—face an inherently dynamic environment where traffic patterns change,
loads are volatile, and service interactions evolve rapidly. This complexity is
especially pronounced in **cloud environments** where:

- **Elastic scaling** creates constantly changing optimization targets
- **Multi-cloud deployments** introduce heterogeneous infrastructure challenges
- **Managed services** limit configuration visibility while requiring optimization
- **Cost-performance tradeoffs** become more critical with pay-as-you-go models

Godon approaches this as a **continuous multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem** that spans all infrastructure environments:
- **On-premise systems** requiring traditional performance tuning
- **Cloud deployments** with elastic, distributed architectures
- **Hybrid setups** bridging local and cloud resources
- **Meta-heuristics** (e.g. Evolutionary Algorithms) excel in such optimization problem fields
- **Optimization** spans the entire **lifecycle** of technology instances

## Capabilities and Caveats
-------------

### What godon is
-------------

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Human Augmentation** | Augments human operators in achieving performance improvements through standardization and industrialization |
| **Knowledge Reduction** | Reduces prior knowledge needed about configuration changes and their implications |
| **Toil Reduction** | Decreases engineering hours spent on manual tuning |
| **Neglect Solution** | Addresses the widespread neglect of broader performance tuning |
| **Pragmatic Tool** | Serves as a practical operations engineering complement |
| **Open-Source Focus** | Prioritizes open technologies first |
| **Continuous Optimization** | Approximates optimal state in dynamic, changing environments |
| **Algorithm Agnostic** | Leverages metaheuristics of all kinds to explore combinatorial spaces |
| **Performance Accelerated** | Utilizes parallelization and acceleration of metaheuristics |
| **Environment Agnostic** | Optimizes across on-premise, cloud, hybrid, and multi-cloud deployments |
| **Cost-Aware** | Balances performance against cloud spending and on-premise TCO |

### What godon is not
-------------

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Human Supervision** | Requires human setup, supervision, and strategic planning |
| **ML-Light Approach** | Machine learning is kept to minimum, used only when needed in implementation details |
| **Approximate Solutions** | Approximates better-than-untouched states rather than guaranteeing global optimum |
| **Not a Framework** | Not a metaheuristics framework itself, but an application of them |
| **Infrastructure Access** | Requires appropriate permissions to monitor and modify configurations |
| **Observability Integration** | Needs metrics and monitoring data to inform optimization decisions |
